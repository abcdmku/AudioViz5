I want to create a new visualizer envirmonment effect like CinematicEffects that can be added to a preset to add effects but i want to create a Kaleidoscope effect. it should be portable as in a can drop it in to a preset using jsx <Kaleidoscope/> and optionally define configs for it using props. i want to control the amount of mirrors, internal reflections, rotation speeds and other common parameters you can adjust with Kaleidoscope. it should take slices of the scene and perfectly mirror them making a pixel perfect Kaleidoscope.
