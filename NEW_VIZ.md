I want to create a new audio visualizer preset that the user is looking down a tunnel where at the end of the tunnel a beat is detected and caused a ripple where the radially around the tunnel represents frequency and the height of the ripple represents intensity. this ripple should travel towards the user. every detected beat (70-180 bpm) should shift the hue of the tunnel from that point on. create variables in the preset so i can adjust anything that has an effect on the renderings of the visualizer
